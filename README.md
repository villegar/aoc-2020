Advent of Code 2020
================

“Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a
variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any
programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest,
interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice
problems, or to challenge each other.” - Eric Wastl
